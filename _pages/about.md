Hi, my name is Sihong He, an **Assistant Professor of Computer Science** at **UTA**.

**I am looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students/summer interns/visiting students to join my lab in Fall 2024.** If you are passionate about related research topics, please email with your CV, transcripts, and several sentences about your research interest. <span style="color: red;">Please include “Future-Maverick” in your email subject/context (this is my email filter).</span> I have a [chinese-version hiring ads](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plIRQfW6pGfK2a1P1t-D0p-K053X7c7nL4XDRfk9-Ho/edit?usp=sharing), click to see details.

I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href='https://www.cse.uconn.edu'> the Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>,  <a href='https://uconn.edu'>University of Connecticut</a>, working with Dr. [Fei Miao](http://feimiao.org). Before my Ph.D. journey at UConn, I received my M.S. degree in Statistics at UC Irvine in 2019 and my B.E. degree in Financial Mathematics in 2017 at [SUSTC (南方科技大学)](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en) which was newly established in 2011 at Shenzhen, China. [(click to read a short story about it)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.10631). I enjoy trying new things, learning new knowledge, and exploring the frontiers of research (which is also a reason why I studied in three different departments during my UG/MS/PhD life :blush:). I also serve as a reviewer/PC member for several top conferences and journals and was selected as a CPS rising star and rising star in AI in 2024.

<span style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">My long-term research goal is to achieve General Embodied AI.</span> Currently, I  mainly focus on developing efficient, robust, secure, adaptive, and explainable decision-making strategies to advance General Embodied AI. My research interests include:

<body>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Intelligent Decision-Making:</b> LLM/Foundation models for decision making, explainable and safe decision-making.</li>
        <li><b>Reinforcement Learning (RL):</b> robust RL, multi-agent RL, federated RL, explainable RL, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):</b> smart city, intelligent transportation, connected autonomous vehicles, smart logistics, robotics, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Control and Optimization:</b> optimal control, robust optimization, distributionally robust optimization.</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

So far, my research has focused on robust multi-agent reinforcement learning for robust interconnected CPS, data-driven robust optimization for efficient mobile CPS, and on the security and safety of CPS. In addition to system modeling, theoretical analysis, and algorithm design, my work involves experimental validation of real-world data. My work has been published in prestigious journals and conferences including International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS), ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS), IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC) and Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR).  

**I am open to research discussion and collaboration, please feel free to send me email!**
